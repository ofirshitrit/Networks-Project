This README provides an overview of the project related to exploring practical traffic analysis attacks on secure messaging applications. The goal of this project is to study and analyze the vulnerabilities of secure messaging applications, specifically focusing on Instant Messaging (IM) groups. In this project, we record communication in at least four IM groups using WhatsApp Web on a PC and Wireshark. The recorded data includes various types of messages such as text, images, files, voice, and video.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main folders:

1. `src`: This folder contains the source code for various components of the project. It may include scripts for data collection, analysis, and any other necessary functionalities.

2. `resources`: This folder contains essential resources for the project, including:
   - `pcap` files: These files store the captured network traffic data using Wireshark. They contain the packets' information and form the basis for analysis.
   - `csv` files: These files may store structured data extracted from the captured packets, enabling efficient analysis and visualization.

3. `res`: This folder contains sub-folders containing images and plots illustrating the results of the analysis. These plots may include graphical representations of traffic patterns, message types, and other relevant metrics.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `src` folder and explore the provided code. This may include data capture scripts, data analysis tools, and any other relevant files.
3. Access the `resources` folder to review the `pcap` files and `csv` files containing captured network traffic data.
4. Use Wireshark to analyze the captured packets and extract relevant information based on the project's objectives.
5. Use the provided code or create your own analysis scripts to process the captured data and generate meaningful insights.
6. As you perform the analysis, refer to the `res` folder for sample images and plots that showcase potential results and findings.

## Usage

The `src` folder contains code snippets and scripts that can be used for data collection, analysis, and visualization. Depending on your specific objectives, you can run these scripts and adapt them as needed.

## Results

The `res` folder contains sub-folders with images and plots that visualize the results of the analysis. These visualizations provide insights into the traffic patterns, message distribution, and other relevant metrics derived from the captured network traffic.

## Disclaimer

This project is conducted for educational and research purposes only. It is important to respect privacy and legal considerations when conducting traffic analysis. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions before capturing and analyzing network traffic.
